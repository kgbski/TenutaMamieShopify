# Tenuta Mamie Shopify Theme - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is a Shopify theme project for Tenuta Mamie that was created from a sample/demo theme. The primary goal is to REMOVE sample content and create a clean, custom design rather than building new features or adding theme customization options.

## Core Principles

### 1. REMOVE, Don't Add
- **Priority**: Remove sample content, placeholder text, and demo features
- **Avoid**: Adding new theme customization options or complex features
- **Focus**: Clean up existing code rather than writing new code
- **Goal**: Create a minimal, clean theme specific to Tenuta Mamie

### 2. Sample Content Removal
- Remove all placeholder text, sample images, and demo content
- Replace sample product descriptions with real Tenuta Mamie content
- Remove demo navigation items and replace with actual business structure
- Clean up sample blog posts and articles
- Remove any "lorem ipsum" or placeholder content

### 3. Theme Simplification
- **NO** user theme customization features
- **NO** complex theme settings or options
- **NO** multiple color schemes or layout variations
- **YES** to hardcoded, brand-specific styling
- **YES** to removing unused sections and blocks

### 4. Code Cleanup Strategy
- Delete unused sections and templates
- Remove sample blocks and components
- Clean up CSS by removing unused styles
- Simplify JavaScript by removing demo functionality
- Remove any "example" or "demo" prefixed files

### 5. Brand-Specific Approach
- Design specifically for Tenuta Mamie's needs
- Use brand colors, fonts, and styling directly in code
- Remove any generic or multi-purpose functionality
- Focus on the specific product types and business model

## File-Specific Guidelines

### Sections (sections/)
- **Remove**: Any sections with "sample", "demo", "example" in name or content
- **Keep**: Core functionality like header, footer, product display
- **Simplify**: Remove complex customization options from section settings
- **Focus**: Clean, minimal sections specific to Tenuta Mamie

### Templates (templates/)
- **Remove**: Sample pages and demo content
- **Simplify**: Remove complex template options
- **Focus**: Essential pages only (home, product, collection, cart, etc.)

### Assets (assets/)
- **Remove**: Sample images, demo graphics, placeholder content
- **Keep**: Only brand-specific assets
- **Clean**: Remove unused CSS and JavaScript

### Config (config/)
- **Simplify**: Remove complex theme settings
- **Focus**: Minimal configuration for Tenuta Mamie's needs
- **Remove**: Any sample or demo configuration options

## Development Approach

### When Making Changes:
1. **First**: Identify what sample content to remove
2. **Second**: Clean up the remaining code
3. **Third**: Only then consider minimal additions if absolutely necessary

### Code Review Checklist:
- [ ] Is this removing sample content?
- [ ] Is this simplifying existing code?
- [ ] Is this specific to Tenuta Mamie's needs?
- [ ] Am I avoiding adding new customization features?
- [ ] Is this making the theme more minimal and focused?

### Red Flags (Avoid These):
- Adding new theme customization options
- Creating complex user settings
- Adding demo or sample content
- Building features that aren't specific to Tenuta Mamie
- Making the theme more complex rather than simpler

## Communication Style
When suggesting changes, always frame them as:
- "Remove this sample content..."
- "Clean up this demo section..."
- "Simplify this by removing..."
- "Delete this unused sample..."

Rather than:
- "Add this new feature..."
- "Create this customization option..."
- "Build this new component..."

## Success Metrics
- Reduced file count (fewer sections, templates, assets)
- Cleaner, more focused code
- Brand-specific styling and content
- Minimal theme settings
- No sample or demo content remaining

Remember: This project is about **subtraction and simplification**, not addition and complexity.
